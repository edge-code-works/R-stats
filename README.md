### Political Repo Highlights

## Description: 
Hi! My name is Jessie Edge! I am a dynamic data scientist with more than six years of experience in leading key stakeholders in making data-driven decisions. I initially found a passion in data science while interning on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. for a U.S. Senator. I was tasked during my internship to develop and maintain an Amendment tracker for the legislative team to track over 570 Amendments proposed to The National Defense Authorization Act of 2016. Pretty cool? I thought so when returning for my senior year in undergrad I volunteered on a few state court judge political campaigns in the local Augusta area and have had a passion for data and politics ever since! Leading to my current role as the managing director of a political data firm. This repo is to provide a way for me to show off some really cool things I can produce without sharing to much information within my current role due to data privacy.  

## TLDR Description: 
Public repo to show off some chunks of my code within my private political repo. 

## Introduction
public is an open-source segment of a larger, proprietary suite of data analysis tools developed by me. This public repository includes several key components that are essential for basic data processing tasks among a political data lense which I am sharing to not only show off my own skills but help others interested in political data analysis.
